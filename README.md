# Wes Bos - Javascript 30 challenge

## Introduction
I was recently asked by my friend to take on this challenge. So I decided to do this for two reasons,

- one is the ability to do these with vanilla JS
- two is to build a habit of writing code everyday outside of my day job.

Also to give a journal view to any others who might be looking to do something similar. I will record as much info as I can, but remember as Wes pointed out there are 'N' number of ways to solve these challenges, my way might not be the best way. This is just a documentation to show one of the ways I would solve it.

Thanks again.
